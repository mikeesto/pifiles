# PiFiles

This is a collection of notes for working with the Raspberry Pi. For work and personal projects, I often find myself searching for the same information over and over again. This site is a way for me to collate it all in one place. A scrapbook of sorts.

## To run locally

In a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

And then to run live preview server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
