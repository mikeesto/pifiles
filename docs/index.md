# PiFiles

This is a collection of notes for working with the Raspberry Pi. For work and personal projects, I often find myself searching for the same information over and over again. This site is a way for me to collate it all in one place. A scrapbook of sorts.

I hope you find it useful too!

The source code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikeesto/pifiles).
